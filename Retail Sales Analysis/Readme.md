# Retail Sales Analysis with SQL, Python & Prophet

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) sales data using **SQL** and **Python**.  
The workflow covers SQL queries for data aggregation, Python for advanced analysis and visualization, and Prophet for time series forecasting.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (SQLite)** â€“ Data storage and queries  
- **Python** â€“ Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Prophet** â€“ Time Series Forecasting  

## ðŸ“Š Key Analyses
1. **Weekly Sales Trends**  
   - Aggregated sales by week using SQL.  
   - Visualized weekly sales patterns with Matplotlib.  

2. **Channel Performance**  
   - Compared **Retail**, **E-commerce**, and **Discount** channels.  
   - Identified performance differences over time.  

3. **Promotion Impact**  
   - SQL queries grouped sales by `promotion_flag`.  
   - Showed that promotions increase average sales.  

4. **Regional Performance**  
   - Analyzed total sales across different regions.  
   - Highlighted the top-performing regions.  

5. **Forecasting**  
   - Built a Prophet model using weekly sales data.  
   - Predicted sales for the next 8 weeks.  
   - Added promotion information as a regressor (advanced).  

## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Insights
- **Promotions** had a significant positive effect on sales.  
- **Retail** channel showed consistent growth compared to others.  
- Some **regions** contributed much higher sales, revealing focus areas.  
- **Forecast model** captured seasonal trends and provided 8-week sales predictions.  

## ðŸ“· Sample Visualizations
- Weekly sales trends  
- Channel performance comparison  
- Promotion vs non-promotion sales  
- Regional sales distribution  
- Prophet forecast output
