# Airline Flight Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes airline flight data to identify delays, cancellations, and route performance. 
It demonstrates a complete workflow: raw CSV dataset → SQL queries → Tableau interactive dashboard.

## Project Components

1. **Python Script (Optional)**  
   - `load_csv_to_sql.py` contains code to load CSV files into a SQL database.  
   - In this project, CSV is referenced from Kaggle; the script is for reference purposes only.

2. **SQL Queries**  
   - `airline_analysis_queries.sql` → General airline and flight delay analysis  
   - `route_performance_queries.sql` → Route-specific performance and top delayed routes  
   - Provides aggregations like average delay, cancellations, and top routes  

3. **Tableau Dashboard**  
   - Visualizes airline performance, airport and route delays, and top delayed routes.  
   - Sheets included:  
     - Airline Performance  
     - Airport / Route Analysis  
     - Flight Points Map  
     - Top Delayed Routes (Heatmap / Table)  

4. **Screenshots**  
   - Example images of the dashboard for reference
