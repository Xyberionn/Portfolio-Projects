# Retail Sales Analysis (Python + SQL + Tableau)

## Project Description
This project demonstrates sales analysis and visualization on an FMCG dataset.  
- Python was used for data preprocessing and weekly/SKU-level visualizations.  
- SQL queries were employed to analyze sales trends, regional performance, and promotion effects.  
- Tableau was used to create an interactive dashboard for visualizing the results.  

**Purpose:** To showcase data analysis and visualization skills, and demonstrate analytical thinking through a Python + SQL workflow.
