This machine learning project classifies Starbucks food items into categories (like Sandwich, Dessert, Breakfast) based on nutritional values.

## 🧾 Dataset
- Nutritional data from Starbucks menu (Calories, Protein, Fat, Carbs, etc.)

## 🎯 Objective
Predict the category of a new food item using its nutritional profile.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- Decision Tree
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
