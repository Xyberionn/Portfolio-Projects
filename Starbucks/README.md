# Starbucks Food Item Classifier

This machine learning project classifies Starbucks food items into categories (like Sandwich, Dessert, Breakfast) based on nutritional values.

## Dataset
- Nutritional data from Starbucks menu (Calories, Protein, Fat, Carbs, etc.)

## Objective
Predict the category of a new food item using its nutritional profile.

## Algorithms Used
- Decision Tree
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Evaluation
- Model comparison with accuracy and confusion matrix
- Feature importance visualization

## Future Work
- Add user interface to classify new food items
- Train with larger nutrition datasets from other chains
